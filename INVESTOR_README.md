# Investor Brief
Validated PoC showing 10–20 min faster response via onboard triage.
This repository contains a simulation-validated technical proof of concept showing how conservative onboard telemetry triage can materially reduce operational latency and bandwidth usage, without relying on complex models or full autonomy. The work is intended to support early technical diligence and operator discussions.
