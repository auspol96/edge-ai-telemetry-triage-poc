# Outputs Directory

This directory contains **generated artifacts** produced by running the Edge AI Telemetry Triage PoC.

All files in this folder are **reproducible** and are created automatically by the pipeline scripts.
They are **not source code** and should not be edited manually.

---

## Telemetry Data

- **telemetry_nominal.csv**  
  Nominal (healthy) multi-channel telemetry generated by the simulator.

- **telemetry_with_anomalies.csv**  
  Telemetry with injected anomalies (spike and drift) applied on top of nominal signals.

---

## Ground Truth

- **ground_truth.json**  
  Machine-readable description of injected anomalies, including:
  - anomaly ID
  - anomaly type (spike, drift)
  - affected channel
  - start and end time
  - intended severity

This file represents the *truth* used for evaluation.

---

## Edge Processing Outputs

- **edge_scores.csv**  
  Per-sample anomaly scores and flags produced by onboard-style edge detection
  (rolling Z-score).

- **events.json**  
  Aggregated anomaly events derived from point-level flags, including:
  - event start and end time
  - duration
  - affected channels
  - maximum anomaly score
  - severity classification (LOW / MED / HIGH)

- **decisions.jsonl**  
  One decision record per event, containing:
  - event timestamp
  - severity
  - recommended action (IMMEDIATE_DOWNLINK, STORE_FORWARD, MONITOR)
  - confidence score

---

## Evaluation Outputs

- **tta_comparison.csv**  
  Per-anomaly comparison of:
  - edge decision time
  - ground-only decision time
  - Time-to-Action (TTA) difference

- **tta_summary.json**  
  Summary statistics of Time-to-Action reduction, including:
  - median ΔTTA
  - mean ΔTTA
  - P90 ΔTTA

---

## Notes

- All outputs are generated from simulation and do **not** represent flight data.
- Results depend on parameters defined in `config/config.yaml`.
- This directory may be safely deleted and regenerated at any time.

---

## Reproducibility

To regenerate all outputs from scratch, run:

```bash
python simulator/generate_telemetry.py
python simulator/inject_anomalies.py
python pipeline/edge_detect.py
python pipeline/triage.py
python evaluation/compare_tta.py
```

---

This folder exists to make PoC results transparent, inspectable, and repeatable.
